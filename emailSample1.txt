From: Cole, John <jxc064000@utdallas.edu>

??The SQL Workshop you signed up for will be from 1:00 to 5:00 in the TI Auditorium in ECSS.  This is just inside the main entrance to the building.  Bring a laptop, preferably with either Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL already installed.  Links for these and for a sample database can be found on my Web site under the Announcements:  http://www.utdallas.edu/~John.Cole.

This is a beginning-level workshop, so no knowledge of SQL is assumed, but I do assume you can program in Java.  Topics will include:


         Basic SQL SELECT queries, as well as slightly more advanced topics like the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses

         Basic SQL UPDATE queries

         Use of SQL Server Management Studio

         Accessing SQL Server from Java using JDBC

See you there.
Prof. Cole
